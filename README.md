## Overview

The Libft project is a fundamental project in the curriculum. It serves as an introduction to the C programming language and the concept of creating a custom library. The main objective of the Libft project is to implement a library of essential C functions that are commonly used throughout various programming tasks. This library can then be used in future school projects, reducing the reliance on built-in C library functions.

In essence, the project encourages students to develop their understanding of the C language and learn how to create reusable code components. It involves writing a wide range of functions, from basic memory manipulation to more complex string and linked list operations.

## Key Components

1. **Memory Functions**: These include functions like `ft_memset`, `ft_memcpy`, and `ft_memmove`, which allow you to manipulate memory at the byte level.

2. **String Functions**: Functions for common string operations like `ft_strlen`, `ft_strdup`, `ft_strlcpy`, and `ft_strlcat`.

3. **Character Functions**: Functions like `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, and `ft_tolower` for character classification and transformation.

4. **String Manipulation**: Functions like `ft_strtrim`, `ft_strjoin`, and `ft_split` for more advanced string operations.

5. **Additional Utilities**: Other utility functions like `ft_atoi` for converting strings to integers, `ft_calloc` for memory allocation, and `ft_bzero` for zeroing out memory.

6. **Bonus Functions**: Implementing functions to create, manipulate, and traverse linked lists. Functions like `ft_lstnew_bonus`, `ft_lstadd_front_bonus`, and `ft_lstmap_bonus` are included in this part.

## Key Skills Developed

1. **C Programming Proficiency**: Gain a strong command of the C programming language, including memory manipulation, string handling, and general programming practices.

2. **Library Creation**: This project emphasizes the creation of a custom library, teaching how to organize and maintain our code for reuse.

3. **Problem Solving**: Developing the various functions in the library requires problem-solving skills to ensure correct implementation and efficiency.

4. **Data Structures**: Implementation of linked lists and other data structures helps students understand the principles of data organization and manipulation.

5. **Algorithmic Thinking**: Bonus functions often require students to implement custom algorithms, promoting algorithmic thinking and optimization.

6. **Code Organization**: The project encourages students to write clean, organized, and well-documented code.

## Usage

```make``` to compile de the library
