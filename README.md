# 42_Libft

This is the first project of the 42 main cursus. 

It is about making a personal C library, filled with functions that can be used in future exercises -if the project allows them to be used!-. There are several functions of known libraries rewritten, for pedagogical purposes. 

The original exercise was smaller. I found useful though to update the library for each project, correcting errors or adding new interesting functions, making it grow with the cursus evolution.

## Usage

```make``` to compile de the library
